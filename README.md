This program is a restaurant management system that allows customers to view a menu, order food items, and for staff to order from their cabins, for vendors to update the menu, manage stock and view total income generated.

Authentication
To access the system, users must authenticate themselves by entering their username and password. There are three predefined user accounts stored in a dictionary. If the user enters the correct username and password, they are granted access to the system.

Identification
Once logged in, the user is prompted to enter their ID. The program determines the user's designation (either Vendor, Staff, or Student) based on the ID prefix entered.

Menu
The menu is stored in a dictionary, which includes the name, price and quantity available for each item. Customers can view the menu, order items and receive a total cost.

Inventory Management
Staff members are given additional options to manage inventory. They can add, update and delete items from the menu. They can also mark an order as delivered or for eat now.

Vendor Management
Vendors are provided with further options to view stock details, edit stock, view/edit vendor details and view the total income generated.

Additional Features
Total consumption is tracked for each food item, so staff can have an accurate record of the most popular items.

Technologies
This program is written in Python, and uses the matplotlib library for data visualization.
